CSS in challenge.css
Notes: The Navbar buttons change to blue color and border on focus. and the notes in the black region change css on hover.

Assumptions: Didnt know what font to use for the "Titles of Sales Page", looked liked an enlarge p tag, but I just used a Default h2,
 so looks bolder.

The script.js contains code for the meter adding notches to thermometer and specifically moving slider and width mercury div
using some JQuery.

(Incompleteness)
The assignment looks fine except for mobile. Needs some tweaks regarding notes in the black region.
And on Edge browser, the labels seem to be too close to the thermometer below screen width of 700px.
