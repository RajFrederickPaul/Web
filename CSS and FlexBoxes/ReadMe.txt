Notes: The Navbar buttons change to blue color and border on focus. and the notes in the black region change css on hover.

The script.js contains code for the meter adding notches to thermometer and specifically moving slider and width mercury div
using some JQuery.  This was done beacuse, the challenge said this part of the HTML could not be changed and so I implemented in JS.
